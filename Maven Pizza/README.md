# MAVEN PIZZA - SQL PROJECT

This is an entry-level project for the analysis in SQL of the Dataset available for free in the mavenanalytics.io website (DATA PLAYGROUND):
https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=pizza.
In the link above you can find the "clean" dataset.
For this project, as starting dataset, I used the dirty dataset provided by Annie Nelson and downloadable here:

So, in this repository you can find different queries, used to **clean** and, only later, **analyze** the dataset (so, you'll find 2 different folders: **Cleaning Queries** and **Analysis**).
In the **Analysis** section, I try to answer to some of the Maven Analytics questions:

***Recommended Analysis**
How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?*
